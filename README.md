# DeepCons_Repeat

This repository includes the code and supplementary material to repeate the experiment described in the paper "Understanding sequence conservation with deep learnnig" by Yi Li, Daniel Quang, and Xiaohui Xie. DeepCons, as described in the paper, is a deep neural network which predicts evolutionarily conserved parts of DNA's noncoding regions.
